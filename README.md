# R Proficiency Demonstration
**This repository is designed for any professors, potential employers who would like to know more about my R proficiency capacity!**
I am currently looking for RA opportunities in behavioral Science field(I am also open for public policy and social work field), please reach out to me if you are interested!

## General Introductions 
I have added hyperlink for all three analysis I've done before, you can click each one of them and it will bring you to the corresponding Github Link. 
<br/>In each repository, there is one **readme.md** file where you can find the basic introduction of the analysis, additional notes and perhaps some of my reflections*(I reckon this part also important as it helps me reflect my codes everytime)*!
<br/>You may also find datasets that are used in the analysis. As my codes are reproducible, you can download the dataset or clone the repository to try it yourself as well *(isn't that amazing the preproducibility)* !
